ZVT is a driver for communicating with payment
devices that implement the zvt protocol

It isn't complete yet and won't be more than 
needed to run the minimal functionalty 
to work as a conduit for a cash register 
project.

At the moment it is a sperate part but it will 
be merged with the ptapi project for simplicity.
